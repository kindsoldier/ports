The ViMbAdmin project (vim-be-admin) provides a web based virtual
mailbox administration system to allow mail administrators to easily
manage domains, mailboxes and aliases.

ViMbAdmin was written in PHP using our own web application framework
which includes the Zend Framework, the Doctrine ORM and the Smarty
templating system with JQuery and Bootstrap.
