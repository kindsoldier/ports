dbus\-cleanup\-sockets \- clean up leftover sockets in a directory
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBdbus\-cleanup\-sockets\fR
command cleans up unused D\-Bus connection sockets. See
\fIhttp://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/\fR
for more information about the big picture.
.PP
If given no arguments,
\fBdbus\-cleanup\-sockets\fR
cleans up sockets in the standard default socket directory for the per\-user\-login\-session message bus; this is usually /tmp. Optionally, you can pass a different directory on the command line.
.PP
On Linux, this program is essentially useless, because D\-Bus defaults to using "abstract sockets" that exist only in memory and don't have a corresponding file in /tmp.
.PP
On most other flavors of UNIX, it's possible for the socket files to leak when programs using D\-Bus exit abnormally or without closing their D\-Bus connections. Thus, it might be interesting to run dbus\-cleanup\-sockets in a cron job to mop up any leaked sockets. Or you can just ignore the leaked sockets, they aren't really hurting anything, other than cluttering the output of "ls /tmp"
.SH "AUTHOR"

dbus\-cleanup\-sockets was adapted by Havoc Pennington from linc\-cleanup\-sockets written by Michael Meeks.
