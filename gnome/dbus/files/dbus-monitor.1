.SH "NAME"
dbus\-monitor \- debug probe to print message bus messages
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.HP 13
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR [\-\-system | \-\-session | \-\-address\ \fIADDRESS\fR] [\-\-profile | \-\-monitor] [\fIwatch\fR\ \fIexpressions\fR]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
The
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
command is used to monitor messages going through a D\-Bus message bus. See
\fIhttp://www.freedesktop.org/software/dbus/\fR
for more information about the big picture.
.PP
There are two well\-known message buses: the systemwide message bus (installed on many systems as the "messagebus" service) and the per\-user\-login\-session message bus (started each time a user logs in). The \-\-system and \-\-session options direct
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
to monitor the system or session buses respectively. If neither is specified,
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
monitors the session bus.
.PP
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
has two different output modes, the 'classic'\-style monitoring mode and profiling mode. The profiling format is a compact format with a single line per message and microsecond\-resolution timing information. The \-\-profile and \-\-monitor options select the profiling and monitoring output format respectively. If neither is specified,
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
uses the monitoring output format.
.PP
In order to get
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
to see the messages you are interested in, you should specify a set of watch expressions as you would expect to be passed to the
\fIdbus_bus_add_match\fR
function.
.PP
The message bus configuration may keep
\fBdbus\-monitor\fR
from seeing all messages, especially if you run the monitor as a non\-root user.
