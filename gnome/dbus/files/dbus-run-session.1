.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBdbus\-run\-session\fR
is used to start a session bus instance of
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR
from a shell script, and start a specified program in that session. The
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR
will run for as long as the program does, after which it will terminate.
.PP
One use is to run a shell with its own
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR
in a text\(hymode or SSH session, and have the
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR
terminate automatically on leaving the sub\(hyshell, like this:
.PP
dbus\-run\-session \-\- bash
.PP
or to replace the login shell altogether, by combining
\fBdbus\-run\-session\fR
with the
\fBexec\fR
builtin:
.PP
exec dbus\-run\-session \-\- bash
.PP
Another use is to run regression tests and similar things in an isolated D\-Bus session, to avoid either interfering with the "real" D\-Bus session or relying on there already being a D\-Bus session active, for instance:
.PP
dbus\-run\-session \-\- make check
.PP
or (in
\fBautomake\fR(1)):

.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\fB\-\-config\-file=\fR\fIFILENAME\fR, \fB\-\-config\-file\fR \fIFILENAME\fR
.RS 4
Pass
\fB\-\-config\-file=\fR\fIFILENAME\fR
to the bus daemon, instead of passing it the
\fB\-\-session\fR
argument. See
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR(1).
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-dbus\-daemon=\fR\fIBINARY\fR, \fB\-\-dbus\-daemon\fR \fIBINARY\fR
.RS 4
Run
\fIBINARY\fR
as
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR(1), instead of searching the
\fBPATH\fR
in the usual way for an executable called
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-help\fR
.RS 4
Print usage information and exit.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-version\fR
.RS 4
Print the version of dbus\-run\-session and exit.
.RE
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.PP
\fBdbus\-run\-session\fR
exits with the exit status of
\fIPROGRAM\fR, 0 if the
\fB\-\-help\fR
or
\fB\-\-version\fR
options were used, 127 on an error within
\fBdbus\-run\-session\fR
itself, or 128+\fIn\fR
if the
\fIPROGRAM\fR
was killed by signal
\fIn\fR.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.PP
\fBPATH\fR
is searched to find
\fIPROGRAM\fR, and (if the \-\-dbus\-daemon option is not used or its argument does not contain a
\fB/\fR
character) to find
\fBdbus\-daemon\fR.
.PP
The session bus' address is made available to
\fIPROGRAM\fR
in the environment variable
\fBDBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS\fR.
.PP
The variables
\fBDBUS_SESSION_BUS_PID\fR,
\fBDBUS_SESSION_BUS_WINDOWID\fR,
\fBDBUS_STARTER_BUS_TYPE\fR
and
\fBDBUS_STARTER_ADDRESS\fR
are removed from the environment, if present.
.SH "BUGS"
