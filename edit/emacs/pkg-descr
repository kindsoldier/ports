GNU Emacs is a self-documenting, customizable, extensible real-time
display editor.

Users new to Emacs will be able to use basic features fairly rapidly
by studying the tutorial and using the self-documentation features.
Emacs also has an extensive interactive manual browser.  It is easily
extensible since its editing commands are written in Lisp.

GNU Emacs's many special packages handle mail reading (RMail) and
sending (Mail), outline editing (Outline), compiling (Compile),
running subshells within Emacs windows (Shell), running a Lisp
read-eval-print loop (Lisp-Interaction-Mode), automated psychotherapy
(Doctor :-) and many more.


LEIM is Libraries of Emacs Input Method.

This enables you to input Multilingual Characters.

To input these characters, select the "language name" in which
you want to input, and evalute the following two expressions:

(set-language-environment "language name")
(toggle-input-method)

The "language name" you can choose is one of these:
  - Chinege		- Chinese-BIG5		- Chinese-CNS
  - Chinese-GB		- Cyrillic-ALT		- Cyrillic-ISO
  - Cyrillic-KOI8	- Czech			- Devanagari
  - Ethiopic		- German		- Greek
  - Hebrew		- IPA		 	- Japanese
  - Korean		- Lao			- Latin-1
  - Latin-2		- Latin-3		- Latin-4
  - Latin-5		- Romanian		- Slovak
  - Thai		- Tibetan		- Vietnamese

In the default keybindings, (toggle-input-method) is bound to `C-\'.
