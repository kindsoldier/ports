The qpdf program is used to convert one PDF file to another equivalent
PDF file.  It is capable of performing a variety of transformations
such as linearization (also known as web optimization or fast web
viewing), encryption, and decryption of PDF files.  It also has many
options for inspecting or checking PDF files, some of which are
useful primarily to PDF developers.
