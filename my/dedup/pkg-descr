Utility for finding files with the same content and creating hard links
to the first copy

The utility is written to find duplicates in the archive of photos  and
videos.   If  when  reading the next file the hash sum and size are the
same as the previous one, it is considered  a  duplicate. File
timestamps are not taken into account.
